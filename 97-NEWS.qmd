Here are the patch notes of the different versions: 


## SCpubr v1.1.1.9000 {.unnumbered}
Current development release.

## SCpubr v1.1.1 {.unnumbered}
Hotfixes in unit tests to comply with CRAN checks.

## SCpubr v1.1.0 {.unnumbered}

### General {.unnumbered}
-   Increased the cell size of all heatmap-based functions from 5 to 8.
-   Decreased the thickness of frame and ticks of all ggplot2-based continuous legends to retrieve a similar behavior as in previous versions of ggplot2, as with the new update, the overall thickness of the frame and ticks increased, probably due to the changes related to `element_line`,
-   Added five new functions: `do_AlluvialPlot()`, `do_AzimuthAnalysisPlot()`, `do_ExpressionHeatmap()`, `do_GroupedGOTermPlot()` and `do_FunctionalAnnotationPlot()`.
-   Added `legend.ncol`, `legend.nrow`, `legend.title` and `legend.byrow` to as many functions as possible to further customize legend appearance.

### `SCpubr::do_BeeSwarmPlot()` {.unnumbered}
-   Added `min.cutoff` and `max.cutoff` parameter.
-   Added ticks to the plot, that were missing.
-   Added missing axes titles.
-   Added `viridis_direction` parameter to control how the continuous color scale is formed.
-   Added `return_object` parameter to return the Seurat object with the enrichment scores computed.
-   Added BoxPlots, BeeSwarmPlots and ViolinPlots to the possible outputs the user can choose from.
-   Make `legend.position` conditional of whether `continuous_feature` is set to TRUE. If it is false, legend is not displayed unless the user specifies otherwise.

### `SCpubr::do_BarPlot()` {.unnumbered}
-   Fixed a bug in which axes titles were not displaying correctly under certain combinations of `flip` and `split.by`.
-   Fixed a bug in which `x_lab` and `y_lab` would not rotate accordingly when using `flip = TRUE`. 

### `SCpubr::do_BoxPlot()` {.unnumbered}
-   Set `assay` to NULL and will default to the default assay in the seurat object.

### `SCpubr::do_CellularStatesPlot()` {.unnumbered}
-   Fixed a bug that prevented FeaturePlots to have symmetrical axes with respect to the main plot.

### `SCpubr::do_CorrelationPlot()` {.unnumbered}
-   Added `viridis_direction` parameter. 

### `SCpubr::do_DimPlot()` {.unnumbered}
-   Fixed a bug in which the legend title will not show up in regular basic plots even though the parameter `legend.title` was used.
-   Completely reformatted the way `split.by` works, so that now only one legend is displayed for the whole group and cells have border.
-   Added `label.size` and `label.box` parameters for further customize the appearance of the plot when using `label = TRUE`. 
-   Changed `repel` to `FALSE` by default. 

### `SCpubr::do_EnrichmentHeatmap()` {.unnumbered}
-   Fixed a bug in the code that prevented the feature plots and the geyser plots to be computed if the input gene list was not a named list of genes.
-   Added `flavor = "AUCell"`, that lets the user compute AUCell scoring of the gene sets. 
-   Added the option to query multiple `group.by` parameters at the same time. 
-   Fixed a bug in the code that prevented multiple outputs with different values of `group.by` to be returned properly, leading to the last value of `group.by` replacing all the rest.

### `SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot()` {.unnumbered}
-   Added `label`, `label.size` and `label.color` parameter to reproduce the same behavior as in `Seurat::FeaturePlot()`. 

### `SCpubr::do_GroupwiseDEPlot()` {.unnumbered}
-   Set `assay` to NULL and will default to the default assay in the seurat object.

### `SCpubr::do_LigandReceptorPlot()` {.unnumbered}
-   Added `arrange_interactions_by` to control how output interactions are arranged (either by aggregate_rank, specificity, magnitude or a combination of magnitude and specificity).
-   Added `sort_interactions_alphabetically` to control whether the output dotplot has the interactions ordered alphabetically or as they come in the original matrix (meaning, they follow the arrangement specified in `arrange_interactions_by`). (([liana's issue  #72](https://github.com/saezlab/liana/issues/72)))

### `do_PathwayActivityPlot()` {.unnumbered}
-   Added a fix in which when `enforce_symmetry` is set to `FALSE`, then the color scale turns into a viridis-based one instead of a two-color gradient scale.

### `do_TFActivityPlot()` {.unnumbered}
-   Added a fix in which when `enforce_symmetry` is set to `FALSE`, then the color scale turns into a viridis-based one instead of a two-color gradient scale.


### `SCpubr::do_ViolinPlot()` {.unnumbered}
-   Fixed a bug in the code in which no different colors could be passed to `colors.use`. 
-   Reduced default line width from 1 to 0.5.

## SCpubr v1.0.4 {.unnumbered} 
- Hotfix for v1.0.3 in which `do_GeyserPlot` with categorical variables had a bug that mapped the legend to the continuous axis.

## SCpubr v1.0.3 {.unnumbered}

### General changes {.unnumbered}

-   Added `min.cutoff` and `max.cutoff` parameter to effectively subset the color scale and remove the effect of extreme outliers in all ComplexHeatmap-based functions.
-   Added `min.cutoff` and `max.cutoff` parameter to effectively subset the color scale and remove the effect of extreme outliers in all ggplot2-based functions susceptible to be biased by outliers.

### `SCpubr::do_DimPlot()` {.unnumbered}

-   Implemented a change in which when using `split.by` and `group.by` in combination, the cells colored on top of the UMAP also have a border.
-   Implemented a bug-fix in which when using `split.by` and `group.by` in combination, the extra new layers would not raster if `raster = TRUE`.
-   Implemented a bug-fix in which when using `split.by` and `group.by` in combination, no plots will appear if `ncol` is set.
-   Implemented a new feature to add density line contours using `plot_density_contour`.
-   Implemented the conditional use of `raster.dpi` to Seurat versions higher or equal to 4.1.0.

### `SCpubr::do_EnrichmentHeatmap()` {.unnumbered}

-   Implemented a bug fix for internal checks in the function.
-   Added `plot_FeaturePlots` and `plot_GeyserPlots` to also report the enrichment scores in a gene set-based manner.
-   Added `flavor` parameter, that accepts `Seurat` and `UCell` to allow for different enrichment scoring methods. It requires `R 4.2.0` to run.
-   Renamed `symmetrical_scale` to `enforce_symmetry` to have a greater coherence accross functions.

### `SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot()` {.unnumbered}

-   Implemented a new feature to add density line contours using `plot_density_contour`.
-   Implemented the conditional use of `raster.dpi` to Seurat versions higher or equal to 4.1.0.

### `SCpubr::do_GeyserPlot()` {.unnumbered}

-   Fixed bug in which internal parameter names made it to the X axis title.
-   Removed `color.by` implementation due to it being very buggy. This will be re-implemented in a future patch.

### `SCpubr::do_RidgePlot()` {.unnumbered}

-   Implemented a bug-fix in which using `assay = "RNA"` or, in fact, any other assay rather than `SCT` will result in an error.

### `SCpubr::do_ViolinPlot()` {.unnumbered}

-   Corrected a bug in which legend title when using `split.by` was an actual line of code.
-   Added `legend.title` parameter to control the title of the legend.

This version can be obtained in the [v1.0.3 release](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/releases/tag/v1.0.3) release or **downloading it from CRAN** using:

#### SCpubr v.1.0.3-dev-stable {.unnumbered}

-   Same as v1.0.3, but with all the functions that do not pass CRAN checks. These functions are: `SCpubr::save_Plot()` `SCpubr::do_LigandReceptorPlot()` and `SCpubr::do_SankeyPlot()`.

This version can be obtained in the [v1.0.3-dev-stable release](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/releases/tag/v.1.0.3-dev-stable) release.

## SCpubr v1.0.2 {.unnumbered}

### General changes {.unnumbered}

-   Change color palette when using `enforce_symmetry = TRUE` to have the middle color as `grey95` instead of the previous one, which made middle values seem closer to the positive end of the scale.
-   Modified internal structure of all functions to abide with [tidyselect v1.2.0 lifecycle modifications](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/news/index.html#lifecycle-changes-1-2-0).
-   Modified `rotate_x_axis_labels` parameter in all functions that made use of it. Now, instead of accepting a `logical`, accepts a `numeric`: either `0`, `45` or `90`, corresponding to the degrees in which the X axis labels should be rotated. ([#5](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/issues/5#issuecomment-1289203453))

### `SCpubr::do_CopyNumberVariantPlot` {.unnumbered}

-   Modified the code for `SCpubr::do_CopyNumberVariantPlot` to also report results for the whole chromosome as well as for each chromosome arm.
-   Include the `verbose` argument to `SCpubr::do_CopyNumberVariantPlot` to silence the messages when there are not enough genes in the chromosome to perform the analysis.

### `SCpubr::do_DimPlot()` {.unnumbered}

-   Fixed a typo that prevented labels to be bold in `SCpubr::do_DimPlot()` when cell borders are displayed.
-   Added `group.by` and `split.by` functionality to `SCpubr::do_DimPlot()`. ([#4](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/issues/4))

### `SCpubr::do_DotPlot()` {.unnumbered}

-   Added ticks to axes.
-   Modified default colors to convey a better aesthetic.

### `SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot()` {.unnumbered}

-   Fixed potential bugs in `SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot` when setting `enforce_symmetry = TRUE`.
-   Changed default value of `order` in `SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot()` from `TRUE` to `FALSE`.
-   Added `min.cutoff` and `max.cutoff` parameters to `SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot()`. This allows to effectively subset the color scale to the values provided. Cells outside the range will be converted to the min or max values provided, respectively. ([#2](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/issues/2))

### `SCpubr::do_GeyserPlot()` {.unnumbered}

-   Added `flip` parameter.

### `SCpubr::do_GroupwiseDEPlot()` {.unnumbered}

-   Fixed bug in `SCpubr::do_GroupwiseDEPlot` in which the heatmap could not be computed. ([#3](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/issues/3))
-   Added extra checks to ensure proper input in `SCpubr::do_GroupwiseDEPlot`. ([#3](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/issues/3))

### `SCpubr::do_LigandReceptorPlot()` (development release) {.unnumbered}

-   Changed parameter `x_labels_angle` to `rotate_x_axis_labels` to keep a consistent terminology.

### `SCpubr::do_RidgePlot()` {.unnumbered}

-   Fixed a typo that made the lines in `panel.grid.minor` to be displayed in `SCpubr::do_Ridgeplot()`.
-   Added `flip` parameter.

-   Added `split.by` functionality to `SCpubr::do_ViolinPlot()`. ([#4](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/issues/4), [#5](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/issues/5))
-   Added `flip` parameter.
-   Now multiple features can be queried ad the same time. ([#5](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/issues/5#issuecomment-1289203453))
-   Changed `feature` parameter to `features`, to better reflect the multiple feature behavior.
-   Recreated `Seurat`'s `share.y.lims` behavior and set it to `share.y.lims` parameter. ([#5](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/issues/5#issuecomment-1289203453))

### SCpubr v1.0.2-dev-stable {.unnumbered}

-   Same as v1.0.2, but with all the functions that do not pass CRAN checks. These functions are: `SCpubr::save_Plot()` `SCpubr::do_LigandReceptorPlot()` and `SCpubr::do_SankeyPlot()`.

This version can be obtained in the [v1.0.2-dev-stable release](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/releases/tag/v1.0.2-dev-stable) release.

## SCpubr v1.0.1 {.unnumbered}

-   Rework on unit tests and examples so that it can pass CRAN R CMD Check without packages in Suggests. This is, to make sure all Suggested packages are used conditionally.

### SCpubr v1.0.1-dev-stable {.unnumbered}

-   Same as v1.0.1, but with all the functions that do not pass CRAN checks. These functions are: `SCpubr::save_Plot()` `SCpubr::do_LigandReceptorPlot()` and `SCpubr::do_SankeyPlot()`.

This version can be obtained in the [v1.0.1-dev-stable release](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/releases/tag/v1.0.1-dev-stable) release.

## SCpubr v1.0.0 {.unnumbered}

-   Modified internal checks so that the functions that do not use `Seurat` do not require this to be installed. This is just for the very side case in which somebody downloads the package just for the `SCpubr::do_ColorPalette()` function.
-   Removed the option to use `individual.titles`, 'individual.subtitles`and`individual.captions`in`SCpubr::do_NebulosaPlot()\` as the benefit of such parameters did not surpass the problems the code was causing. The feature might come back in the future, once fully optimized.
-   Removed `SCpubr::save_Plot()` function to align with CRAN policies that the package should not write to the file system. The code is still available in the v0.0.0.0.9000 release in Github.
-   Removed `SCpubr::do_LigandReceptorPlot()`, `SCpubr::do_SankeyPlot()` and `SCpubr::do_PseudotimePlot()` to align with CRAN policies and make it possible to publish the package. These functions can still be accessed in the v0.0.0.0.9000 release in Github.
-   Removed `SCpubr::do_PseudotimePlot()` for the reason above and because the dependency `Matrix.utils` was removed from CRAN on *09-10-2022*.

This version can be obtained in the [v1.0.0 release](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/releases/tag/v1.0.0) release.

### SCpubr v1.0.0-dev-stable {.unnumbered}

-   Same as v1.0.0, but with all the functions that do not pass CRAN checks. These functions are: `SCpubr::save_Plot()` `SCpubr::do_LigandReceptorPlot()` and `SCpubr::do_SankeyPlot()`.

This version can be obtained in the [v1.0.0-dev-stable release](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/releases/tag/v1.0.0-dev-stable) release.

## SCpubr 0.0.0.9000 {.unnumbered}

-   Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
-   Prepare package for submission to CRAN.
