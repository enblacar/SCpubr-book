# Feature plots 
Another broadly used function in `Seurat` is `Seurat::FeaturePlot()`. It is basically the counterpart of `Seurat::DimPlot()` which instead of coloring the cells based on a categorical color scale, it uses a continuous one, according to a variable provided by the user. This can range from gene expression, to metadata variables such as the number of genes, or even values such as PC_1. 



```{r echo = F}
sample <- readRDS("/b06x-isilon/b06x-g/G703/eblanco/projects/test_SC_datasets/sc_dataset.rds")
```

## Basic usage

This is SCpubr's take on `Seurat::FeaturePlot()`:
```{r, fig.cap= "SCpubr do_FeaturePlot vs Seurat FeaturePlot", fig.width=14, fig.height=8}
p1 <- Seurat::FeaturePlot(sample, 
                          features = "PC_1")
p2 <- SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot(sample = sample,
                             features = "PC_1")
p <- p1 | p2
p
```

By default, `SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot()` enlarges the dots a bit and makes the legend bold, to better stand out. Even though axes are removed from UMAP reductions, the title for the axes is kept for any other reduction used. The same is applied for UMAP if the default dimension order is altered.

```{r, fig.cap = "SCpubr Feature with PCA embedding showing axes titles.", fig.width=14, fig.height=8}
p1 <- SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot(sample = sample, 
                             features = "CD14",
                             plot.title = "Plotting PCA coordinates",
                             reduction = "pca")
p2 <- SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot(sample = sample, 
                             features = "CD14",
                             plot.title = "Plotting UMAP coordinates in a different order",
                             dims = c(2, 1))
p1 | p2
```

## Multiple features

`SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot()` can tackle multiple queries at the same time. Plots can be rearranged as desired with `ncol` parameter:

```{r, fig.cap = "SCpubr FeaturePlot, with 4 features and 2 columns", fig.width=14, fig.height=16}
p <- SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot(sample, features = c("nCount_RNA", 
                                                 "nFeature_RNA", 
                                                 "percent.mt", 
                                                 "CD14"), 
                            plot.title = "A collection of features", 
                            ncol = 2)
p
```

With multiple queries, using `plot.title` parameter actually adds a general title to all plots. If one wants to modify the title of each plot independently, a vector **of the same length as the number of features** needs to be provided to `individual.titles` parameter. In case a title does not need to be changed, use `NA` instead.

```{r, fig.cap = "SCpubr FeaturePlot, with individual modified titles", fig.width=16, fig.height=14}
p <- SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot(sample = sample,
                            features = c("nCount_RNA",
                                         "nFeature_RNA",
                                         "percent.mt",
                                         "CD14"),
                            plot.title = "A collection of features",
                            individual.titles = c("Plot A",
                                                  "Plot_B",
                                                  NA,
                                                  "Plot_D"),
                            ncol = 2)
p
```
The very same concept can be applied to subtitles and captions. When plotting one feature, `plot.subtitle` and `plot.caption` are used to specify them. :

```{r, fig.cap = "SCpubr FeaturePlot, with subtitle and captions", fig.width=7, fig.height=8}
p <- SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot(sample = sample,
                            features = c("CD14"),
                            plot.title = "Expression of CD14",
                            plot.subtitle = "CD14 is a marker gene",
                            plot.caption = "Plot generated using SCpubr.")
p
```

And similar to `individual.plots` parameter the very same applies if you want to provide individual subtitles or captios to a multi-feature plot. For this, you need to use `individual.subtitles` and `individual.captions`. 

```{r, fig.cap = "SCpubr FeaturePlot, with individual modified titles, subtitles and captions.", fig.width=16, fig.height=14}
p <- SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot(sample = sample,
                            features = c("nCount_RNA",
                                         "nFeature_RNA",
                                         "percent.mt",
                                         "CD14"),
                            plot.title = "A collection of features",
                            plot.subtitle = "Everything is commented!",
                            plot.caption = "Dataset from: ...",
                            individual.titles = c("Plot A",
                                                  "Plot_B",
                                                  NA,
                                                  "Plot_D"),
                            individual.subtitles = c("Subtitle A",
                                                  NA,
                                                  "Subtitle C",
                                                  "Subtitle D"),
                            individual.captions = c("Caption A",
                                                  "Caption B",
                                                  "Caption C",
                                                  "Caption D"),
                            ncol = 2)
p
```

## Working with subsets of cells

One of the things that can be misleading, is that it could be the case that a very specific subset of cells are driving the ends of the color scales. Let's say that we have identified that clusters 2, 5, and 8 are responsible of this behavior. We would like to have plot the values without taking those cells into consideration. The very first thing that comes to mind is, indeed, removing the cells completely, resulting in the following:

```{r, fig.cap = "SCpubr FeaturePlot, removing cells from clusters 2, 5 and 8", fig.width=7, fig.height=8}
cells.plot <- colnames(sample[, !(sample$seurat_clusters %in% c("2", "5", "8"))])
p <- SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot(sample[, cells.plot], 
                            features = c("CD14"), 
                            plot.title = "My very important features")
p
```

However, this falls back to the same problem as with `Seurat::DimPlot` with the `split.by` parameter. We lose the overall context of where the cells are. This is taken care by in `SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot()`, when using the `cells.highlight` parameter:

```{r, fig.cap = "SCpubr FeaturePlot, masking cells from clusters 2, 5 and 8", fig.width=7, fig.height=8}
cells.plot <- colnames(sample[, !(sample$seurat_clusters %in% c("0", "2", "5", "8"))])
p <- SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot(sample = sample, 
                            cells.highlight = cells.plot, 
                            features = c("CD14"), 
                            plot.title = "My very important features")
p
```
This way, by adding the cells back and modifying the legend, we accomplish the desired effect. Furthermore, `SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot()` also accepts a vector of the identities to plot, as long as they are part of `levels(seurat_object)`. This can be achieved by using the `idents.highlight` instead.

```{r, fig.cap = "SCpubr FeaturePlot, masking cells from clusters 2, 5 and 8 using idents.highlight", fig.width=7, fig.height=8}

p <- SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot(sample = sample, 
                            idents.highlight = levels(sample)[!(levels(sample) %in% c("0", "2", "5", "8"))], 
                            features = c("CD14"), 
                            plot.title = "My very important features")
p
```
## Splitting the FeaturePlot by a variable
In some cases, we want to visualize a given feature, let's say, the expression of `LYN` across another variable, for instance `seurat_clusters`. This can be achieved easily in `Seurat` by using the `split.by` parameter. For the sake of representation, let's reduce the number of clusters.

```{r, fig.cap = "Seurat FeaturePlot split by clusters.", fig.width=14, fig.height=4}
# Group clusters.
sample$new_clusters <- as.character(sample$seurat_clusters)
sample$new_clusters[sample$new_clusters %in% c("0", "1", "2", "3")] <- "Cluster 1"
sample$new_clusters[sample$new_clusters %in% c("4", "5", "6")] <- "Cluster 2"
sample$new_clusters[sample$new_clusters %in% c("7", "8", "9")] <- "Cluster 3"

p <- Seurat::FeaturePlot(sample, 
                         features = "LYN", 
                         split.by = "new_clusters")
p
```
Apart from the general aesthetic discrepancies mentioned before, there are two main aspects missing. First, is the overall layout of the UMAP embedding. Being able to correctly locate the clusters is really important. Secondly, knowing that, by default, the color scale is shared across all the plots (achieved by using `keep.scale = "feature"`), we would like to know up to which value this color scale reaches. In this two aspects is where `SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot()` delves into: 

```{r, fig.cap = "SCpubr FeaturePlot split by clusters.", fig.width=14, fig.height=4}
p <- SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot(sample = sample, 
                            features = "LYN", 
                            split.by = "new_clusters")
p
```

This way, we are able to achieve a better understandable plot. Please note that this has been implemented for `keep.scale = "feature"`. Providing other options is not advisable. Furthermore, we can query multiple features, them being stacked by the different entities in `split.by`. The number of columns is predetermined to the number of entities and can not be modified. In this example, we provide each of the three possible examples of features:

- `LYN` is a gene located in the rownames of the count matrix (`rownames(sample)``).
- `nCount_RNA` is a metadata variable located in `colnames(sample@meta.data)`.
- `PC_1` is a column of a dimensional reduction embedding, located in `colnames(sample@reductions[["pca"]][[]])`

```{r, fig.cap = "SCpubr FeaturePlot split by clusters using multiple features.", fig.width=20, fig.height=4}
p <- SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot(sample, 
                            features = c("LYN", "nCount_RNA", "PC_1"), 
                            split.by = "new_clusters")
p
```

With `SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot()` we can even subset the previous plot to any identities in `split.by` we are particularly interested in. The color scale also limits itself to contain only the values in the selected identities. This can be achieved by provided a vector with the identities to `split.by.idents` parameter.

```{r, fig.cap = "SCpubr FeaturePlot split by clusters using multiple features and selected identities.", fig.width=20, fig.height=5}
p <- SCpubr::do_FeaturePlot(sample, 
                            features = c("LYN", "nCount_RNA", "PC_1"), 
                            split.by = "seurat_clusters", 
                            split.by.idents = c("2", "5"))
p
```
