Here are the patch notes of the different versions:

## SCpubr v1.0.1 {-}

-   Rework on unit tests and examples so that it can pass CRAN R CMD Check without packages in Suggests. This is, to make sure all Suggested packages are used conditionally.

This version can be obtained in the [v1.0.1 release](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/releases/tag/v1.0.1) release or **downloading it from CRAN** using:

``` r
install.packages("SCpubr")
```

### SCpubr v1.0.1-dev-stable {-}

-   Same as v1.0.1, but with all the functions that do not pass CRAN checks. These functions are: `SCpubr::save_Plot()` `SCpubr::do_LigandReceptorPlot()` and `SCpubr::do_SankeyPlot()`.

This version can be obtained in the [v1.0.1-dev-stable release](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/releases/tag/v1.0.1-dev-stable) release.

## SCpubr v1.0.0 {-}

-   Modified internal checks so that the functions that do not use `Seurat` do not require this to be installed. This is just for the very side case in which somebody downloads the package just for the `SCpubr::do_ColorPalette()` function.
-   Removed the option to use `individual.titles`, 'individual.subtitles`and`individual.captions`in`SCpubr::do_NebulosaPlot()\` as the benefit of such parameters did not surpass the problems the code was causing. The feature might come back in the future, once fully optimized.
-   Removed `SCpubr::save_Plot()` function to align with CRAN policies that the package should not write to the file system. The code is still available in the v0.0.0.0.9000 release in Github.
-   Removed `SCpubr::do_LigandReceptorPlot()`, `SCpubr::do_SankeyPlot()` and `SCpubr::do_PseudotimePlot()` to align with CRAN policies and make it possible to publish the package. These functions can still be accessed in the v0.0.0.0.9000 release in Github.
-   Removed `SCpubr::do_PseudotimePlot()` for the reason above and because the dependency `Matrix.utils` was removed from CRAN on *09-10-2022*.

This version can be obtained in the [v1.0.0 release](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/releases/tag/v1.0.0) release.

### SCpubr v1.0.0-dev-stable {-}

-   Same as v1.0.0, but with all the functions that do not pass CRAN checks. These functions are: `SCpubr::save_Plot()` `SCpubr::do_LigandReceptorPlot()` and `SCpubr::do_SankeyPlot()`.

This version can be obtained in the [v1.0.0-dev-stable release](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/releases/tag/v1.0.0-dev-stable) release.

## SCpubr 0.0.0.9000 {-}

-   Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
-   Prepare package for submission to CRAN.
