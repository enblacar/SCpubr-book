## SCpubr 0.0.0.9000

- Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
- Prepare package for submission to CRAN.
- Removed `SCpubr::save_Plot()` function to align with CRAN policies that the package should not write to the file system. The code can be requested in scpubr@gmail.com, if somebody still wants it or is still available in the {v.0.0.0.9000 release}(https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr/releases/tag/v.0.0.0.9000) in the [GitHub](https://github.com/enblacar/SCpubr).
