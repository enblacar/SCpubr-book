This is normally displayed whenever you load the package for the first time in the session.\n\nlibrary(\"SCpubr\")\n\n\nIn this, you will have at glance the information needed to run the package:\n\nWhich SCpubr version you have installed and which is the latest version.\nWhich dependencies are installed or missing.\nWhich functions can be run with the current installed dependencies.\n\nIf this message does not appear, you can always generate it using SCpubr::package_report():\n\nSCpubr::package_report()\n\n\nThis will print the concise version of the startup message. If you want the exact same as the startup, use startup = TRUE.\nAlso, it is possible to check the packages needed on a function by function manner. For this, use SCpubr::check_dependencies(), providing the name of the function to check. If not, all functions will be printed.\n\nSCpubr::check_dependencies(function_name = \"do_DimPlot\")"
