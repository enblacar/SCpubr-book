    "text": "Control cell borders\nA very nice addition than enhances visibility of any plot where cells are drawn as dots is to add a black border around them. However, just changing the shape to a dot with border results in a very clogged visualization. It is more interesting to add another layer of black cells underneath the real plotting layer, so that only the cells on the edges will be visible, thus forming an outline border.\nWhile this greatly increases the plot size, it is a trade-off one can consider when making a final figure for a publication. This behavior can be accessed via the following parameters:\n\n\nplot_cell_borders: Whether to plot the cell borders (TRUE) or not (FALSE).\n\nborder.size: Size of the dots used for the cell borders.\n\nborder.color: Color of the dots used for the cell borders.\n\nborder.density: Controls how many cells are used to generate the borders. A value between 0 and 1`. It computes a 2D kernel density of the cells in the dimensional reduction embedding and based on this cells falling below the border.density quantilye are excluded. This helps decreasing the added weight to the plot when plot_cell_borders = TRUE, but might result in an uneven border for the cells."

This can be used with the following:\n\n\ndiverging.palette: Which RColorBrewer diverging palette to use.\n\nIn such cases, the color palette used is chosen among the diverging palettes in RColorBrewer and can be chosen using diverging.palette."

One example are volcano plots, where having the 0 in the X axis in the center helps understanding the spatial disposition of the dots in the plot. Some other cases, we might be plotting a continuous variable that has a diverging nature, and we would like to have a diverging color scale used on it and the limits of the scale also being centered around the middle point. for this, we can use the following:\n\n\nenforce_symmetry: Whether to make the plot symmetrical (TRUE) or not (FALSE). This varies depending on the function. It can make the axes symmetrical between them or make the color scale diverging and the limits centered around the middle value."
