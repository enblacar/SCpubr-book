This package aims to provide a streamlined way of generating publication ready plots for known **S**ingle-**C**ell visualizations in a "**pub**lication **r**eady" format (**SCpubr**). This is, the aim is to automatically generate plots with the highest quality possible, that can be used right away or with minimal modifications for a research article. 

As subjective as the term "aesthetically pleasant" can be, this a set of theme modifications implemented across different plot types. This package also serves as a personal project, with future prospects of growth.
