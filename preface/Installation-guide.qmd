This summary will provide you with the information you need to run the package:

- The version of **SCpubr** you have installed and the latest version available.
- The status of your **dependencies** (installed or missing), including the current and latest version of each installed dependency.
- The **functions** that can be run based on your currently installed dependencies.

Note that some packages, such as `Seurat`, `ggplot2`, or `dplyr`, require a minimum version. If your installed version is not high enough, these packages will be marked with an exclamation mark.

If you do not see this message, you can always generate it by using `SCpubr::package_report()`.

You can also check the required packages for a specific function by using `SCpubr::check_dependencies()` and specifying the function name.
