# About this package {-}
<img src="images/SCpubr_logo_big.png" width="300" height="300" align = "center" alt="" class="cover" /> This package aims to provide a streamlined way of generating publication ready figures for known single-cell visualizations. As subjective as the term "aesthetically pleasant" can be, this a set of theme modifications implemented across different plot types. This package also serves as a personal project, with future prospects of growth.
